# Dcache

A Caching system inspired in [Memcached](https://github.com/memcached/memcached)  
This is a personal project I used to understand more about TCP connections, application level protocols and cache, that's why Dcache has its own protocol and does not support Memcached protocol.  



## Install

```bash
  go get github.com/joaovictorsl/dcache
```
    
## Usage

Check the [examples repository](https://github.com/joaovictorsl/dcache-examples).
